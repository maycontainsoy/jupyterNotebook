    "#### Changing the plot axes\n",
    "It is very easy to label data, but a bit fiddly when modifying the axes labels at first. This is something I still struggle with from time to time. The simplest modification is changing the labels on the axes. With the `plt.xticks` and `plt.yticks` commands you need to specify (1) location of the labels and (2) string values for those labels. In the plot below, I changed the labels for the x-axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Labels and Plot Legend\n",
    "When adding data to a plot, you can and a label to that data set that will identify it when you envoke the `plt.legend` command. Try changing the argument of the loc= in `plt.legend()` to move the legend around the plot. The default is usually ok, but occasionally you will need to move the legend. You can also adjust the size of the figure such that the legend will not obscure any data. You can uncomment the `plt.xlim` and `plt.ylim` to change the figure size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modifying Data Sets in Plot\n",
    "The `plot` command has a lot of options for output, too many to list here (again, the online documentation is very helpful, <a href=\"https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html\">Plot Options</a>). Here, I have passed a single data set as the argument so the default is to plot those values on the y-axis with the indices acting as the x-axis. If you pass two data sets, it assumes the first data set is the x-axis data and the second is the y-axis data, i.e. `plt.plot([x],[y])`.\n",
    "\n",
    "_(Side note: Latex formatting usually works in plot titles and labels, for some reason I can get it to work in the_ `xticks` _but not in the title. I need to look into why it is throwing back an error and revise that piece.)_"
